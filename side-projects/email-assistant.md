# Email Assistant

I use ChatGPT quite a lot to help me write emails. Decided to roll out a chrome extension, that does the very same thing in my Gmail.

Then I figured that Gmail will roll it out as a feature, but with Bard.

Now, I'm testing the current version in my own Gmail, and trying to figure out if I can make a small product out of it.

Maybe a chrome extension that works with different webmails?
