# Investor Evaluation

It's a useful calculator that helps startups to compare investor offers based on numbers. It basically calculates how much money ends up in your pocket in different exit scenarios. (By default, in 100 different scenarios.)

Then you can do the same for two investors, and see in how many exit scenarios you are better off chosing the first, and how many you are better off choosing second investor.

This is a great tool to negotiate better and better offers, and it is FREE.
