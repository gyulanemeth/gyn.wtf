# Build, Show & Tell

We started a weekly meetup within the #buildinpublic community on twitter. We have had 4 meetups already, and currently working on the website.

It is an extremely lean project. Currently, we sign up people with google forms, we have a discord channel, and we use google meets for the meetups. That's it! We are currently working on a very, very [sexy website](https://twitter.com/thinkcler/status/1666848150995316759).
