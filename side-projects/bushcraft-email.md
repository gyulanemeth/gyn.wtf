# bushcraft.email

I moved next to a forest approx half a year ago. It triggered my long-forgotten knife-mania and the love of the outdoors.

I started watching lot of bushcraft videos on YouTube and I bought quite a lot of knives, ferrocerium rods, and similar stuff. Basically, I'm playing with these in the forest in my free time.
I learned quite a lot already, for example how to make fire right after rain with a ferro rod and with the stuff you find in the forest or on the fields.

I'm also checking out lot of bushcraft-related products, almost every day. These are knives, axes, saws, paracords, backpacks, and other gear.

I'm also working on bluefox.email, with which you can send newsletters, promotional emails, and transactional emails.

I thought it might be interesting for others if I share bushcraft-related
 - youtube videos
 - products
 - tutorials
 - tips

on a weekly basis.

A weekly newlsetter will be a great test-ground for my product, bluefox.email, and I would love to share the stuff with others that I check out anyways, almost every day.

What about the business side? You might ask.

Well, I honestly don't know yet. First of all, I wanna see if I like to do it even after a few months. I wanna see if I can find enough people who are interested in this content. Finally, I wanna see if I can find people to collaborate with, for example YouTubers.

If I wanna do it after half a year, I find audience and collaborators, then I will think about sponsorships. I think it will be sponsored slots for bushcraft-related products, but would not put any shitty product into the newsletters, only the ones that my audience would probably love.
