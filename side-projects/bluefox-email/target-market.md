# [bluefox.email](https://bluefox.email) target market

Companies who have a substantial email list often find that services like Mailchimp and other major players are becoming prohibitively expensive. This particular segment benefits greatly from design systems, as they streamline the management of the large volume of emails they handle. Additionally, excellent deliverability is crucial for them, as they have reached a point where they must prioritize their conversion rates.

I'm okay with companies / people with smaller email marketing operations to use my software. I don't even wanna ask money from them, but I want them to be another marketing channel.
