Since I have quite a lot of experience in the email field, I decided to build a newsletter / campagin tool. I know, that there are tons of similar products, but I always wanted to build one. :sunglasses:

Okay. So, I wanted to build it... But why would you care?

There are two reasons. Firstly, it boasts an amazing design system that guarantees brand consistency across all email campaigns. Secondly, it leverages AWS SES, which is undoubtedly one of the best solutions for achieving exceptional deliverability.

::: tip
