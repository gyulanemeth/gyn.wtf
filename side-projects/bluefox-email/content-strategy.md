# [bluefox.email](https://bluefox.email) content strategy

The two main parts of the content strategy is the website and twitter. As anyone would guess, I wanna publish useful content for my target audience on the website, and while creating those, actively tweet about them.

The focus should be on **design systems in email** and how awesome **AWS SES is for deliverability.**

## Website
 - email marketing concepts (categorized by topics) -> heavily use ChatGPT??? (not sure about gpt yet)
 - design systems in email marketing -> mega article (this is one of the USPs)
   - then I can show how to do it in bluefox email
 - Sending out emails with AWS SES & Deliverability -> mega article (this is the other USP)
   - then I can show how to do it in bluefox email
 - tutorials about the product itself (text + video -> should use text to speech )

## Twitter
 - based on conversations on twitter, I decided to create a separate account for [bluefox.email](https://twitter.com/bluefoxemail)
 - product updates
 - updates about the website content
 - tweets while researching the website content
 - try to make friends

## Slack (emailgeeks)
 - try to make friends
 - email design channel, esp channel, deliverability channel
 - validate that I can find my target audicence here.


## Reddit
 - need to explore
   - should talk to @heyimsunflower
