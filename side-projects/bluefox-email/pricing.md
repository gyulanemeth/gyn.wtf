# [bluefox.email](https://bluefox.email) pricing

At the beginning, I don't wanna deal with a complicated pricing model. I also don't wanna deal with recurring payments, because that might take a lot of manual work if something goes wrong. For example, expired cards, or rejected payments by random banks in random countries.

There will be a free and a paid version of the service. In the paid version, you can get a 1-year access for a single checkout. This model also makes it possible to easily increase the price of a 1-year access whenever I want. It means, that people who get access very early, will most likely have to pay more in the second year. (I wonder how many of them will churn.)

## Free version

Use the product for free as much as you want, but we put our logo & link to our website in the footer of your emails. Or maybe do the same, but in a thin section right before the original email header.

So, we will use free users to spread the word.

## Paid version

I don't know the proper price for this product yet, so the idea is, that I start from $100 for a 1-year access. After I can sell 10 of this on this price, I increase it to $200. If I can sell 10 of those, then increase it to $300 and so on.

After a while, I should find the optimal price, that I should not increase anymore. I will need to take into account how much I could sell on a certain price level in a standard time period, eg. 1 month.

## Presales
I might try to sell it before rolling out. Maybe 1 year access for $50 or something like that. That's not a lot of money if you consider the monthly cost, but it's actually quite a huge sum if we consider that I ask it for the value proposition only.
