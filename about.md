# About me

Hey, I'm Gyula NÃ©meth (GYN).

![Me](/me.png)

I am a co-founder and CTO of an SaaS company since 2013. Now, it's a company of 20 people, and we have rolled out several email design-related products. Our current products are [chamaileon](https://chamaileon.io), which is an HTML email management platform for teams, and [Email Hero](https://emailhero.io), an enterprise email templating solution focusing on huge digital publishing companies with numerous brands.

As a CTO, I have built everything from the ground up, and I am also heavily involved in business decisions and sales processes.

My role has evolved in a way that I deal less and less with actual tech stuff and development. I am most useful as a mentor, guiding others and keeping them on the right track.

However, I started to miss hands-on work, so I began working on a few side projects, including some open-source ones.

This website is dedicated to these projects.
